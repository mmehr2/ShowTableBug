# ShowTableBug

Code showing a bug in Swift 1.2 (and other versions?) when adding arrays. It causes overly long compilation times, as in over a half hour on a 2012 Mac Mini Core i7 2.3 GHz with 16GB RAM and a 250GB SSD.

Check out the explanations in ViewController.swift (rest of project is boilerplate from XCode 6.3.2).
